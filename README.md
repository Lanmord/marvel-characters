## Setup

1.  Go to the official [Marvel developers](https://developer.marvel.com) website and create a new account. After that, you will find a private and a public key inside your developer's profile page.

2.  Generate a new `.env` file inside the root path of this repository and place them like this:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=12345
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_KEY=12345
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
